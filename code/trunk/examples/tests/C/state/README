This example shows how to model a state network with S-Net,
that is garbage-collectable and serves as basic pattern for
all networks that have to model state in some way.

Encapsulated by a serial replication, there is *first*
a synchrocell followed by a parallel composition.
The sync-cell will merge the current state and the input
record into a single record.
The parallel composition has a branch that will operate on the
merged record, by means of updating the current state by the input value,
i.e. generating a new state and (optionally) producing output that will leave
the serial replication.
The other branch is a simple bypass that allows to bypass unprocessed
input values into successive instances of the seial replication to reside
in synchro cells and wait for the state to arrive.

In this example, the box 'add' just adds the input value to the current state,
emits the current state as new state record and the old state as output value
record that will leave the replication immediately.
