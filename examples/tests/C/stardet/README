Simple non-deterministic serial replication.

The geninput.sh script allows to generate
a sequence of records that will leave the replication
pipeline at random points.

Synopsis:

  ./geninput.sh <num_records> <max_depth>

num_records specifies the number of records that are generated,
max_depth specifies the upper limit of randomly generated values.
