Testing a sync-star construct.
This construct is useful for continuous synchronisation.

The geninput.sh script generates an xml input data file
containing records of tags A and B n following way:

  ./geninput.sh <repeats> <depth>

will create <depth> times record with tag A followed by <depth> times
record with tag B. This pattern is repeated <repeats> times.
The value of tags A and B is an increasing number.


Example:
  ./geninput.sh 2 3

will generate following sequence of records:

A=0, A=1, A=2, B=0, B=1, B=2,
A=3, A=4, A=5, B=3, B=4, B=5
