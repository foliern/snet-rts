This file shows the meaning of LPEL flags

-i <input file>: specify input file

-m <monitoring flag combination>: enable monitoring (for more detail, see LOGFORMAT)

-w <num>: specify the number of workers
-wo <num>: specify the number of cores for others/wrapper
By default: w = #cpus 
            wo = 0


-excl: workers and wrappers executed on exclusive cpus, i.e. one worker has its own cpu
 If this flag is used:
    + pinned mode must be enable (by default)
    + wo > 0
    + #cpus >= w + wo

- dloc: explicit allocation for task (from the snet file)
  + if any snet entity is not specified, location would be 0

- sosi <num>: support source/sink
  + dloc mode should not be used
  + num: number of core for source/sink, core from 0 -> num - 1: sosi, core from num ->...: workers
  + from the snet file, entity with location > 0 will be mapped to sosi, otherwise on normal workers
